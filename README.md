🔧 Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js & npm (Node Package Manager):

Download and install from the official Node.js website: nodejs.org

npm is included with Node.js.

To verify installation, open your terminal/command prompt and run:

node -v
npm -v

Git: For cloning the repository.

Download and install from the official Git website: git-scm.com

⚙️ Installation
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/speakedge-ai.git # Replace with your actual GitHub repo URL
cd speakedge-ai

Install dependencies for both frontend and server:
This project uses npm workspaces, allowing you to install all dependencies from the root directory with a single command. concurrently will also be installed as a dev dependency in the root.

npm install

This command will automatically navigate into frontend and server folders and install their respective dependencies, as well as the root-level dependencies.

▶️ Running the Application
Once all dependencies are installed, you can start both the frontend and backend servers concurrently using a single npm script:

Start the development servers:

npm run dev

This command will:

Start the React development server (frontend).

Start the Express.js server (backend).

Access the application:

Frontend: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

Backend API: The backend server will be running on http://localhost:5001 (or the port configured in your Express app).
